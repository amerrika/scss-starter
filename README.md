# My SCSS Starter Folder

## Intro

Of course, while learning CSS3 I came accross some popular CSS3 Frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind and I didn't really like them. The reason is that I've become pretty comfortable with vanilla CSS3 and I've been doing only my personal projects for learning purposes so I haven't felt the need to get into these frameworks.

What I do like though, is SCSS. I learned the basics of it such as nesting, partials, mixins, inheritence and some of the at-rules
that help to better organize a code. To start a new project with some pre-written code I created this starter. The inspiration for it I found in Kevin Powell's [Website Starter Template](https://github.com/kevin-powell/website-starter-template-v3) which is way more complex and more advanced.
Also, this way I keep learning about CSS3 and exploring some modern CSS3 techniques like fluid typography or adjustable paddings using calc, clamp, min and max functions etc.

## Start Using It

`sass --watch sass/main.scss main.css`
